# IIIF Workbench
<br>


**Uploading and serving IIIF images & manifests using GitHub Pages**

IIIF Workbench lets one easily upload images and IIIF manifests to GitHub, automatically creating pre-generated IIIF tiles and serving them via GitHub Pages â€” no need to run own IIIF image server.

**Installation & Deployment**

**Credits**

This project builds on the **original IIIF Workbench** created by [Glen Robson](https://github.com/glenrobson/iiif-workshop) from the **IIIF-C**.
It was developed as part of the [IIIF Online Workshop](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/day-two/image-servers/level0-workbench.html) to demonstrate how IIIF Image API can be used with static hosting.
